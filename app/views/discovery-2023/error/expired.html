  <div class="nhsuk-grid-row">
    <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds">

      <h1>Your invitation to set up an NHS login has expired</h1>  


      <p>This could be because:
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you received it more than <strong>7 days ago</strong></li>
        <li>you have already set up an NHS login account</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you received your invitation more than <strong>7 days ago</strong>, it has expired and will no longer work. If you want to set up an NHS login, you will need to ask your GP to send a new invitation.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have already set up an NHS login, you can use it to access health and care apps or websites, such as the <a href="https://www.nhsapp.service.nhs.uk/login">NHS App</a>, or <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS website</a>.
